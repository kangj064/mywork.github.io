          I suddenly fell in love with classical music at the age of 21, so I made an orchestra club.<br>
          Inspired by the fairy tale book Bremen Musician, the goal was to approach classical music in a friendly manner.<br>
           tried to use the power of innocence of fairy tales.<br>
          Through this process, I developed true communication skills and gained leadership with various friends.<br>
          and we was awarded the best club award in the school.
